.SYNOPSIS
    Builds a clean, WordPress.org-ready copy of FormForge into build/form-forge/
    and zips it to build/form-forge.zip.

.DESCRIPTION
    Copies the plugin into build/form-forge/, then runs `composer install
    --no-dev` INSIDE that copy only. Your working vendor/ folder (with the dev
    tools like phpcs/wpcs) is never touched. Run this before every release.

.EXAMPLE
    ./build.ps1

# mpdf/mpdf ships ~80 TTF/OTF font files (DejaVu, FreeFont, and many others for
# scripts like Devanagari/Khmer/Syriac/etc, ~88MB total) covering every font it
# ever might need. FormForge only ever *selects* one of 4 families — see the
# font_family match in includes/PDF/templates/layout.php ('dejavusans' [default],
# 'dejavuserif', 'dejavusansmono', 'freemono') — and mPDF's autoScriptToLang/
# autoLangToFont/useSubstitutions are all left at their default of false in
# Generator.php's $mpdf_config, so mPDF never auto-*switches* to a different font
# family for unsupported scripts.
#
# CORRECTION (2026-08-20): an earlier version of this comment claimed that meant
# mPDF "never touches any font file outside these 4 families" — that turned out
# to be wrong and caused a real production failure ("Cannot find TTF TrueType
# font file DejaVuSerifCondensed.ttf") the first time a submission actually
# exercised it. useSubstitutions genuinely does default to false (verified
# against vendor/mpdf/mpdf/src/Mpdf.php directly), but that's a different
# mechanism (missing-glyph fallback) from what actually fired here: mPDF's own
# built-in font-alias tables (vendor/mpdf/mpdf/src/Config/FontVariables.php,
# 'serif_fonts'/'sans_fonts') list the Condensed variant of each DejaVu family
# *before* the plain one, and that alias table is consulted independently of
# useSubstitutions/autoScriptToLang whenever mPDF resolves a font by role rather
# than by our literal $forge_font family name. Rather than chase every internal
# mPDF alias path that could reach a "trimmed away" file, keep the Condensed
# companions too — they're cheap (~2.5MB combined for both families) next to the
# ~85MB this step actually saves (which is almost entirely the CJK/Devanagari/
# Khmer/Syriac/etc script fonts FormForge has no path to ever request). Trimming
# ONLY in the staged release build (never the working vendor/, which a plain
# `composer install` would just restore anyway, and which stays full for local
# testing). If you add a fifth selectable PDF font, add its files to $keepFonts
# below or this step will delete them and PDF generation will fatal on "font
# file not found."

# scratch tmp/ dir (mPDF only falls back to vendor/mpdf/mpdf/tmp when no 'tempDir' is

# a phar-building shell script (WordPress.org's Plugin Check disallows shipping shell
# scripts) plus the build artifacts/PHP script it invoked. None of this is needed at
# runtime; none of it is excluded by composer.json's own `require-dev` (that only
